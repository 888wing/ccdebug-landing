          <h2>Launch Announcement</h2>
          <p>
            After months of development, we're thrilled to officially launch CCDebugger - 
            your AI-powered debugging companion for Claude Code. This tool represents a 
            fundamental shift in how developers approach debugging, moving from reactive 
            problem-solving to proactive, intelligent error analysis.
